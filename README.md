## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Franziska (she/her). 

I emphasize a balanced approach that considers both user and developer perspectives, aiming to create a supportive and enjoyable work environment for everyone. 
- I enjoy both backend development and frontend design, particularly debugging code. 
- Currently, Iâ€™m building a chatbot out of personal interest and am curious to learn about AI.
